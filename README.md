## Introduction
An accounting system built on Norwegian bookkeeping principles, designed to provide a user-centric experience, while ensuring full control over financial transactions.
It includes a comprehensive logging system that tracks every stage of a voucher's lifecycle, from initial creation to updates 
and even deletion (reversal), ensuring complete transparency and traceability.

## Features
- **Vouchers**: Create, get, update and delete vouchers
- **Temporary Vouchers**: Create, get, update and delete temporary vouchers
- **Report**: Get financial transactions
- Preloaded with 200 voucher entries, providing a realistic dataset for testing and development.
- Logging feature that tracks each voucher's lifecycle.
- Documentation with Swagger
- Includes validation of fields and proper api responses

## Technologies

- **Backend**: Spring Boot with Maven and Java
- **API Docs**: Swagger UI and OpenAPI v3
- **DB**: PostgreSQL

## Concept Clarification
**Voucher:** Voucher that are posted. They follow conventional voucher rules.

**TempVoucher:** Temporary vouchers that are not yet posted. They are created for provisional use and may not necessarily follow conventional voucher rules. Can be deleted.

**ReverseVoucher:** A special type of voucher specifically designed to reverse another voucher. It mirrors the original voucher with opposite (negative) values to effectively cancel its impact.

**UpdateVoucher:** A special type of voucher used to modify or adjust an existing voucher.

**PostingSets:** Groups of multiple postings, characterized by sharing the same date.

**FMS:** File Management System. The fms folder serves as an example of a basic file management system.
